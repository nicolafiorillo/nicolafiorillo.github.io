## Kata description
The API should provide the following functionality:

- Ability to accept an arbitrary number of digits which should be appended to any previously received digits to form a long number.
- Ability to clear the previously received list of digits
- Calculates a checksum given the current state and returns it
- Return a timeout response if checksum can't be calculated in less than 15ms

### Checksum calculation

1. Add up the digits in odd positions and multiply by 3
2. Add up the digits in even positions
3. Add up the results of 1 and 2
4. Divide by 10 and take the remainder.
5. If the remainder is 0 final result is 0 otherwise subtract it from 10 for final result

Example:

5 4 8 9 8 5 0 3 5 4

```
5 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 5 = 26 * 3 = 78
4 + 9 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 25
78 + 25 = 103
103 / 10 = 10.3 = 3
10 - 3 = 7
```

## Test client

- Reads a test input file for commands, each row contains a single command
- Store received checksums and append to final result
- Final output should be concatenated string of checksums
- Any unrecognised commands, empty lines or commands that error should be ignored

#### Commands

- Add: The row begins with capital letter `A` followed by a number of digits, ex: `A18237283`
- Clear: The row begins with capital letter `C`
- Checksum: The row begings with letters `CS`

<p>Despite network was unavailable and projector was incompatible with Mac, I had a great talk at <a href="https://www.agilemovement.it/workingsoftware/">Working Software Conference 2019</a>.</p>

<p>More a lession than a talk, people were extremely involved and very interested about differences between OO dev and Elixir dev minds.</p>

<p>Here slides and video.</p>
